# Strcutures Exercises

I am following this article [Data Structures in Javascript](https://medium.com/siliconwat/data-structures-in-javascript-1b9aed0ea17c) to brush up my knowledge on how to implement different structures in Javascript.

I also added to this repo some exercises present on the amazing [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1/258-0512278-8055656?ie=UTF8&qid=1543427580&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview) book.

If you want to play around you just need to run `npm test`.
The project contains my implementation and the implementation given by the author of the article.

PS: There are so many exercises that my intention is to try to solve as many as possible. Therefore I'll not validate function arguments or make tests for those scenarios. :)
