# Algorithm Exercises

This repo is aggregating the solution to exercises I do daily to improve my coding fundamentals.
It has exercises for:

- Array
- LinkedList
- Queues/Stack
- Trees/Graphs
- Sorting algorithms
- Other cool challenges that I stumble upon

The main source of exercises was this [Data Structures in Javascript](https://medium.com/siliconwat/data-structures-in-javascript-1b9aed0ea17c) article and the [Cracking the coding interview](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cracking-Coding-Interview-6th-Programming/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1/258-0512278-8055656?ie=UTF8&qid=1543427580&sr=8-1&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview) book.

If you want to play around you just need to run `yarn test` after running `yarn` to install the packages.

I am happy to receive pool requests with ideas on how to improve any of the solutions.
